# Framework Roadmap

What is needed to evolve `rust-web-server` from an HTTP toolkit into a framework suitable for serious application development. Items are ordered by impact — the first three unlock everything else.

---

## Blockers — cannot build a real application without these

### 1. Shared application state

`App` is a zero-sized `Copy` struct. `Controller` methods are all static `fn` with no `&self`. There is no way to inject a database pool, config struct, cache, or any shared resource into a handler.

**Target API:**
```rust
let app = App::new().with_state(AppState {
    db: Pool::connect(&database_url).await?,
    config: Config::from_env(),
});
```

Every controller would receive `&AppState` (or a typed extract from it) alongside `&Request`.

---

### 2. Dynamic routing with path parameters

Routes are hardcoded if/else chains in `App::execute`. There is no way to define `/users/:id` and receive `id` as a value — every handler must manually parse the URI string. A REST API with 20 endpoints means 20 manual string operations, and no route is declarative or inspectable.

**Target API:**
```rust
app.get("/users/:id", UserController::show);
app.post("/users",    UserController::create);
app.delete("/users/:id", UserController::destroy);
```

The router extracts named segments (`:id`) and wildcard segments (`*path`) and makes them available in the handler as typed values.

> ✅ **Partially done (v17.6.0):** `Router` in `src/router/mod.rs` provides standalone dynamic routing with `:param` and `*wildcard` extraction. Handlers receive `&PathParams`. Integration with the built-in `App::execute` is pending (item 1 — shared state — is the prerequisite for wiring it cleanly).

---

### ✅ 3. Middleware pipeline — _Deferred: requires architectural change_

There is no pipeline. Cross-cutting concerns — authentication, rate limiting, request tracing, header injection — require editing `App::execute` directly. There is no way to compose behavior without touching core dispatch code.

**Target API:**
```rust
app.wrap(AuthMiddleware::new(secret))
   .wrap(RateLimiter::new(100))
   .wrap(RequestLogger::new());
```

Each middleware wraps the next, forming a chain. A request flows inward through the chain before reaching the handler, and the response flows back outward.

---

### ✅ 4. HTTP/1.1 keep-alive (persistent connections) — _Done (v17.4.0)_

Every request requires a new TCP handshake. A browser loading a page with 10 assets makes 10 TCP connections. `Server::process` reads one request then closes. The fix is to loop over requests on the same stream until `Connection: close` is received or the read times out.

---

## Major gaps — severely limits real-world use

### 5. Async handlers

The HTTP/1.1 path blocks one OS thread per connection. With 200 threads (the default) and any I/O waiting — a database query, an external API call — the pool saturates at 200 concurrent users. The HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 paths use tokio, but handlers have no async interface and cannot `await` anything.

**What is needed:** Controllers that can return a `Future`, and a tokio-backed executor for the HTTP/1.1 path as well, eliminating the fixed thread-count ceiling.

---

### ✅ 6. Typed request extractors — _Done (v17.7.0)_

`FromRequest` trait in `src/extract/mod.rs`. Built-in extractors:
- `Body` — raw bytes (never fails)
- `BodyText` — UTF-8 string (returns 400 on invalid UTF-8)
- `Query` — parsed query parameters as `HashMap<String, String>`
- `RequestHeaders` — all request headers with case-insensitive `get`

Implement `FromRequest` on your own type for custom extraction logic.

---

### ✅ 7. Duplicate dispatch logic — _Done (v17.6.0)_

`App::execute` and `App::handle_request` were nearly identical if/else chains over the same controllers. Adding one route required editing both. Fixed: `App::handle_request` now delegates to `App::execute` with a synthetic `ConnectionInfo`, eliminating the duplicate dispatch code.

---

### ✅ 8. Streaming responses / chunked transfer encoding — _Done (v17.4.0)_

Every response body is fully assembled in memory before the first byte is sent. A 500 MB file allocates 500 MB of RAM and holds it for the entire write. Both `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` (HTTP/1.1) and the native stream framing in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 need to be wired to an iterator or async stream that the controller produces incrementally.

---

### ✅ 9. Typed error handling — _Done (v17.6.0)_

`Application::execute` returns `Result<Response, String>`. Production code needs typed errors that carry their own HTTP status code, so a handler can return `Err(AppError::NotFound)` and the framework maps it to a 404 without the handler building the response manually.

`IntoResponse` trait and `AppError` enum are in `src/error/mod.rs`. `AppError` covers 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, and 500. Implement `IntoResponse` on your own error type for custom mappings.

---

## Secondary gaps — painful in practice

### ✅ 10. Cookies — _Done (v17.4.0)_

`CookieJar` parses the `Cookie` request header. `SetCookie` builds `Set-Cookie` response values with all RFC 6265 attributes.

---

### ✅ 11. Response compression — _Done (v17.4.0)_

Automatic gzip compression for text responses when the client sends `Accept-Encoding: gzip`.

---

### ✅ 12. `ConnectionInfo` peer address type — _Done (v17.8.0)_

`ConnectionInfo::peer_addr() -> Option<SocketAddr>` and `Address::to_socket_addr() -> Option<SocketAddr>` helpers added as non-breaking additions. The raw `ip: String` / `port: i32` fields are preserved for backward compatibility; the helpers parse them on demand.

---

### ✅ 13. Graceful shutdown — _Done (v17.7.0)_

`Server::run` (HTTP/1.1 thread pool path, `http1` feature) now installs a Ctrl+C/SIGTERM handler via the `ctrlc` crate. On signal: the accept loop exits, `SERVER_READY` is cleared (causing `/readyz` to return 503), and `ThreadPool::join()` drains all in-flight connections before returning. The async paths (`run_tls`, `run_quic`) have handled graceful shutdown since v17.5.0.

---

### ✅ 14. No test client — _Done (v17.6.0)_

`TestClient<A>` in `src/test_client/mod.rs` dispatches requests in-process through any `Application` without opening a TCP socket.

```rust
let client = TestClient::new(App::new());
let res = client.get("/healthz").send();
assert_eq!(200, res.status());
```

---

### ✅ 15. WebSocket support — _Done (v17.8.0)_

`src/websocket/mod.rs` provides RFC 6455-compliant WebSocket protocol primitives:
- `WebSocket::is_upgrade_request(&request)` — detects Upgrade/Connection/Key headers
- `WebSocket::handshake_response(&request)` — builds the `101 Switching Protocols` response (SHA-1 accept key, base64 encoded)
- `WebSocket::read_frame(stream)` — reads one frame, handles client-to-server masking
- `WebSocket::write_frame(stream, frame)` — sends a server-to-client unmasked frame
- `Frame` enum: `Text`, `Binary`, `Ping`, `Pong`, `Close`, `Continuation`
- Convenience methods: `send_text`, `send_close`, `send_pong`

Real-time features (chat, live updates, collaborative editing) are now possible. Because WebSocket requires raw stream access after the 101 response, the handler must drive its own accept loop rather than returning from a `Controller::process` call.

---

### ✅ 16. HTTP → HTTPS redirect — _Done (v17.4.0)_

`RWS_CONFIG_HTTP_REDIRECT_PORT` binds a plain-HTTP listener that issues `301 Moved Permanently` to the HTTPS equivalent URL.
