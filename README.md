# rws

Static file web server and HTTP toolkit written in Rust. Supports HTTP/3, HTTP/2, and HTTP/1.1. HTTP/3 and HTTP/2 require a TLS certificate; without one the server falls back to plain HTTP/1.1 automatically.

Use it as a ready-to-run binary **or** pull it in as a library crate to get battle-tested building blocks — request/response parsing, routing, headers, MIME detection, body parsing, JSON, logging — without taking on a full async framework.

## Install

```bash
cargo install rust-web-server
```

This installs the `rws` binary with HTTP/3, HTTP/2, and TLS support included.

## Run

### Plain HTTP/1.1

```bash
rws
```

Starts on `http://127.0.0.1:7878` by default. Place your files in the working directory and open the URL in a browser.

### HTTPS + HTTP/2 + HTTP/3

Generate a self-signed certificate for local development:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=localhost" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"
```

Start the server with the certificate:
```bash
rws --tls-cert-file=cert.pem --tls-key-file=key.pem
```

Open `https://127.0.0.1:7878` in a browser. The server listens on the same port for both TCP (HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 via ALPN) and UDP (HTTP/3 via QUIC). HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are negotiated automatically — no extra configuration needed.

For a public domain, obtain a certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

### Custom address and port

```bash
rws --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=443 --tls-cert-file=cert.pem --tls-key-file=key.pem
```

See [CONFIGURE](CONFIGURE.md) for all configuration options (env vars, config file, command-line flags).

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bohdaq/rust-web-server.git
cd rust-web-server
cargo build --release
```

The binary is at `target/release/rws`.

To build with HTTP/2 only (no QUIC/HTTP/3):
```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features http2
```

To build HTTP/1.1 only (smallest binary, no TLS):
```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features http1
```

## Features

- HTTP/3 over QUIC (UDP) — negotiated via `Alt-Svc`
- HTTP/2 with ALPN negotiation alongside HTTP/1.1 on the same TCP port
- TLS via [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) (aws-lc-rs backend, no OpenSSL)
- HTTP/1.1 keep-alive — persistent connections; `Connection: close` or idle timeout ends the session
- Response compression — automatic gzip for text types when client sends `Accept-Encoding: gzip`
- Large file streaming — chunked transfer for files > 8 MB; no full-file buffering
- HTTP → HTTPS redirect — set `RWS_CONFIG_HTTP_REDIRECT_PORT` to redirect a plain-HTTP port
- Cookie handling — `CookieJar` parses the `Cookie` header; `SetCookie` builder creates `Set-Cookie` values
- CORS — allowed for all origins by default, fully configurable
- HTTP Range Requests — partial file serving and multi-range responses
- HTTP Client Hints
- ETag and 304 Not Modified — conditional requests skip body transfer on cache hit
- Security headers — `Strict-Transport-Security` (HTTPS only), `Content-Security-Policy` (configurable via `RWS_CONFIG_CSP`), `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`
- WebAssembly MIME type — `.wasm` files served as `application/wasm`
- Combined Log Format (CLF) — access log compatible with GoAccess and AWStats; set `RWS_CONFIG_LOG_FORMAT=json` for structured JSON logs
- Graceful shutdown — Ctrl+C and SIGTERM stop the server cleanly (async/TLS paths); `/readyz` returns `503` during drain
- Kubernetes-ready — health probes (`GET /healthz` liveness, `GET /readyz` readiness), Prometheus metrics (`GET /metrics`), `0.0.0.0` default bind, Dockerfile included
- Dynamic routing — standalone `Router` with `:param` and `*wildcard` path matching
- Typed errors — `IntoResponse` trait and built-in `AppError` mapping to HTTP status codes
- Typed request extractors — `FromRequest` trait; built-in `Body`, `BodyText`, `Query`, `RequestHeaders`
- Per-IP rate limiting — sliding-window `RateLimiter`; configurable via env vars
- In-process test client — `TestClient` dispatches requests without a TCP socket
- WebSocket support — RFC 6455 handshake, frame encode/decode, SHA-1 + base64 built in, no extra dependency
- Shared application state — `App::with_state(S)` shares `Arc<S>` across state-aware route handlers
- Middleware pipeline — `App::new().wrap(layer)` stacks composable `Middleware` layers; built-in `RateLimitLayer` included
- Async handlers — `App::with_async_state(S)` gives route handlers an `async fn` signature (`http2` feature, tokio-backed)
- Server-Sent Events — `Sse` builder produces a buffered `text/event-stream` response with correct headers
- Session management — `SessionStore` thread-safe in-memory sessions with TTL; cookie helpers included
- Serde JSON — `Json<T>` extractor and responder backed by `serde_json` (`features = ["serde"]`)
- Auth middleware — `BasicAuthLayer` (HTTP Basic) and `JwtLayer` (HS256 JWT) (`features = ["auth"]`)
- Graceful shutdown — Ctrl+C and SIGTERM drain in-flight connections on all server paths
- 30-second read timeout per request on plain HTTP/1.1 connections
- Symlink resolution
- `.html` extension inference — `/page` serves `page.html`; `/dir` serves `dir/index.html`
- Custom 404 page — place a `404.html` in the working directory to override the default

## Use as a library

Add the crate to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-web-server = "17"
```

Implement a controller and plug it into the server in a few lines:

```rust
use rust_web_server::controller::Controller;
use rust_web_server::request::{METHOD, Request};
use rust_web_server::response::{Response, STATUS_CODE_REASON_PHRASE};
use rust_web_server::range::Range;
use rust_web_server::mime_type::MimeType;
use rust_web_server::server::ConnectionInfo;

pub struct PingController;

impl Controller for PingController {
    fn is_matching(request: &Request, _: &ConnectionInfo) -> bool {
        request.method == METHOD.get && request.request_uri == "/ping"
    }

    fn process(_: &Request, mut response: Response, _: &ConnectionInfo) -> Response {
        response.status_code = *STATUS_CODE_REASON_PHRASE.n200_ok.status_code;
        response.reason_phrase = STATUS_CODE_REASON_PHRASE.n200_ok.reason_phrase.to_string();
        response.content_range_list = vec![
            Range::get_content_range(b"pong".to_vec(), MimeType::TEXT_PLAIN.to_string())
        ];
        response
    }
}
```

## AI adoption

This framework is designed to be an AI first class citizen — AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, Copilot) generate correct, idiomatic, compiling code on the first try.

See [AI_ADOPTION.md](AI_ADOPTION.md) for the full strategy: using the server as an AI API backend, adding SSE streaming for token-by-token output, implementing an MCP tool server, and the steps to make the framework maximally discoverable by AI tools (`llms.txt`, Cargo examples, ergonomic helpers, system prompt file).
